Remember, the git pull command will fetch changes and merge them into your current branch. 

If you want to only fetch changes and not merge them immediately, you can use 

#git fetch origin new_branch 

and then inspect the changes separately before merging them into your local branch using 


#git merge origin/new_branch.




#git pull origin new_branch
